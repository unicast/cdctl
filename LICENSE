cdctl is free for non-commercial use.  If you're a company and you find it 
useful, talk to me about letting me use your name in the cdctl package.  I do
NOT charge for my software.

You know, I was pondering what license to release cdctl under when I realized
that this software is so trivial that no one in their right mind would pay me
for it.  Then I thought about releasing it under the GPL, but I'd get patches
from people anyway, and it seems silly to make that a requirement to download
the software.  So I'm just going to make it free for everyone who's not a
company.  Enjoy!
