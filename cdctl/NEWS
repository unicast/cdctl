Version 0.15
 - Fixed an option parsing bug
 - 2.0 support by Andy Thaller <andy_thaller@physik.tu-muenchen.de>
   Thanks, Andy!
 - Confirmed to work on an ATAPI system by Dan Morrison <dmorriso@buffalo.edu>
 - Doesn't dump core anymore if there's no disc in the drive.  Added more
   user-friendly error message hinting that the user should stick a disc in :)
 - Added automount / unmount stuff (-u option) and explanation in README
 - Fixed improper error handler in do_play()
 - Added development version on host30.frys.com and a make-dist command
 - Added drive door locking (-o option) for newer kernels
 - Added capability printout for newer kernels
 - Fixed a nasty memset(3) bug where I used strlen() to figure out the length
   of a string that HAD NOT BEEN INITIALIZED YET, so strlen merrily walked off
   the end until it found a NULL somewhere, overwriting the cdrom file
   descriptor in the process.  
 - cdctl does an eject and quits if it is called as "eject" by symlink,
   hardlink, or renaming.
 - Wrote a cdctl.1 man page
 - Added GNU autoconf support
 - Added GNU gettext(3) support and a few German messages
 - NOTE THAT CAPABILITY READBACK IS BROKEN IN 2.2 ON ATAPI DRIVES, says Jens
   Axboe, the kernel cdrom maintainer. 
 - Granted permission to Debian to make a package for commercial distribution.
 - Does anyone know how to make RPMS?  Mail thalakan@technologist.com if you
   do.
   
Version 0.14
 - Updated version.c and the usage message; thanks to Andy Piper
   <andyp@argonet.co.uk> for the diff.
 - Added speed selection
 - Completely redid the opening option logic; cdctl -e /dev/scd3 works now.
 - Added some crypto stuff so paranoid people can verify that they really got my
   code
 - Added -d option to switch discs in a multi-cd changer
 - Added some infrastructure to do garbage collection on signal interception
   (see rt.c)

Version 0.13
 - Added -m option to read the MCN (also knows as the UPC) from the drive.
   Needs some work; needs to know when the MCN is all zeros.
 - Updated documentation about DVD drives.

Version 0.12
 - Just found out that BSDI actually has a cdctl(1) program :)  The only things
   it does that my cdctl doesn't do are: print a hash code for the table of
   contents, print the table of contents, and add an option to block until 
   playing is complete.  BSDI's cdctl(1) hasn't been maintained for over three
   years, so I think it's safe to take over the name.  BSDI guys, please drop me
   a line if I'm missing something here...
 - Added the ability to list the table of contents (-l)
 - Added the ability to print individual table of contents entries (-t)
 - Added the CDROMSTOP ioctl (-s)
 - Fixed another bug with the cdrom finding hieuristic
 - Talked to Jans, the cdrom driver maintainer, about DVD support and some other
   things.  Looks like I'm going to be the new cdrom driver documentation guy :)
 - Sent a note to linux-kernel about some of the structs in cdrom.c.  Maybe we
   should start ripping all the old cruft out of the cdrom driver's data
   structures now that we have 2.3...

Version 0.11
 - Updated documentation to mention the CDROM environment variable.  Thanks to
   Thomas Soares <ttsoares@cedep.ifch.ufrgs.br> for pointing this out.
 - Put my personal, not company address in the README
 - Made the DVD part a little clearer
 - Added NUTSANDBOLTS file 
 - Fixed bug with cdrom seek hieuristic and open_cdrom() return values

Version 0.10
 - Added license.
 - Added -g (cd_printstatus()) option to print cd status.
 - Added stuff to the README.
 - Added sndreset.pl, not tested.
 - Tossed some more comments into the parsing code.
 - First post to Freshmeat, woohoo!  I got hits from Xeroc Parc to Dow-Corning,
   from Italy to France to Sweeden... I had no idea that Freshmeat was so
   cosmopolitan :)

Version 0.02

 - Implemented many ioctls.
 - Rewrote for getopt_long().
 - Added sndreset utility to reset sound channel on machines with broken apm 
 - Test version, not released.

Version 0.01 (alpha)

 - Test version, not released.
